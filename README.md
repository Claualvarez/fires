#               FiRES: Find Repeated Elements in Structure              #
#   A computational method for the de novo identification of repeats    #


INSTRUCTIONS 
(Linux)

1) Prerequisites

   1.1 List::MoreUtils module for perl
   
       $ cpanm List::MoreUtils
   
   1.2 DSSP

       $ sudo apt-get update
       $ sudo apt-get install dssp

   1.3 Click

      You can find tha standalone version of click here:
       http://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/click/Download/Download.jsp


2) Installation

   2.1 Extract the compressed package
      
       $ unzip fires-master.zip
       $ cd fires-master

   2.2 Modify paths to the scripts' directory in the fires controller script:

       path_to_fires='/path/to/fires-master/scripts'

   2.3 Define the paths to your DSSP and Click directories at 
   the top of the fires controller script:
   
        $path_to_click="/path/to/click";
        $path_to_dssp="/path/to/dssp";

   (make sure to type only the path but not the name of the program)

   
3) Test

       $ bash ./fires 1wm5.pdb A
       $ bash ./fires 3e3x.pdb A
       
   To save the top non-overlapping results run:
   
       $ bash ./fires [pdb_file] [chain_name] > [output_name]
       
   e.g.
   
       $ bash ./fires 1wm5.pdb A > 1wm5.A.fires_output.txt

4) FiRES results

   4.1 FiRES generates three output files:
       a) A list of similar structural elements
       b) A structural alignment of the similar structural elements
       c) A table of the best candidates, including those that were 
	 excluded during the final evaluation step (marked with !)
	 

Note: FiRES takes as input a standard DPB file. It is strongly recommended to use
      PDB files generated by the get_pdb script from Rosetta modeling software.
